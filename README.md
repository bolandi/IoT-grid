IoT-grid
========

Introduction
-------------
Internet-Of-Things-grid (IoT-grid) is the communication and protocol support 
for power and energy management for Internet and IoT devices. Virtually 
all networked devices can collaborate.

### Key components:
* IoT-grid controller-units (IoTgc) 
* IoT-grid servers (IoTgs)

The concept has been developed at Royal Institute of Technology/KTH school
of ICT Stockholm Sweden. Several student projects and courses has been 
contributing to the concept.  (http://www.kth.se) `http://www.kth.se` 


The current hardware platform for the IoT-grid controller unit is based ARM 
MCU. Current software implementation is based the Contiki platform using COAP 
protocol for grid communication.

This repository consist of simple scripts to facilitate building and cloning
the current projects to boost research, development, collaboration and
education.
